      "While \"Torch\" isn't the official name for NYU's primary general-purpose HPC cluster, it's possible it might be:\n",
      "1.  An older, decommissioned HPC system at NYU.\n",
      "2.  A specialized cluster or partition within Greene that is heavily used for PyTorch-related deep learning research, leading to an informal \"Torch cluster\" moniker.\n",
      "3.  A specific departmental or research group's local cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, assuming you're interested in NYU's central, large-scale HPC resource for research, here's an overview of **Greene**:\n",

      "\n",
      "### **NYU's Greene HPC Cluster: Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "Greene is NYU's primary, state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, managed by NYU IT. It is designed to support the diverse computational needs of faculty, researchers, and students across all disciplines, enabling them to tackle complex scientific and data-intensive problems that exceed the capabilities of personal workstations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features and Architecture:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Purpose:** Provides a powerful shared computing environment for a wide range of research, including:\n",
      "    *   Computational Physics and Chemistry\n",
      "    *   Bioinformatics and Computational Biology\n",
      "    *   Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (especially Deep Learning)\n",
      "    *   Data Science and Big Data Analytics\n",
      "    *   Financial Modeling\n",
      "    *   Social Sciences and Digital Humanities\n",
      "    *   Engineering Simulations\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Naming:** Named after Peter Greene, a founder of Washington Square Park, reflecting NYU's commitment to cutting-edge research.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Node Types:** Greene is composed of various types of computing nodes to cater to different workloads:\n",
      "    *   **Standard Compute Nodes:** Equipped with modern multi-core CPUs and substantial RAM, suitable for general-purpose parallel processing.\n",
      "    *   **GPU Nodes:** Crucial for accelerating machine learning (especially deep learning with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow), molecular dynamics, and other highly parallelizable tasks. These typically feature NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., V100s, A100s).\n",
      "    *   **High-Memory Nodes:** Designed for jobs that require very large amounts of RAM (e.g., certain bioinformatics analyses, in-memory databases).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Interconnect:** Nodes are connected by a high-speed, low-latency network (typically InfiniBand) to allow for efficient communication between processes running on different nodes, critical for Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Storage:** Features a high-performance parallel file system (like IBM Spectrum Scale/GPFS) providing fast access to data for all compute nodes, with terabytes of scratch space for active jobs and project-specific storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Job Scheduler:** Utilizes **SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)**, a widely adopted open-source workload manager. Users submit jobs to SLURM, which intelligently allocates resources (CPUs, GPUs, memory) and schedules them for execution based on availability and priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Operating System:** Typically runs a Linux distribution (e.g., CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux variant).\n",

      "**Software Environment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Greene provides a rich software environment with:\n",
      "*   **Compilers:** GCC, Intel Compilers, NVIDIA HPC SDK.\n",
      "*   **Libraries:** MPI (OpenMPI, MVAPICH), BLAS/LAPACK, FFTW, CUDA, cuDNN, Intel MKL.\n",
      "*   **Scientific Applications:** MATLAB, R, Python with extensive scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.), Gromacs, VASP, Amber, ANSYS, COMSOL, and many more.\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, JAX.\n",
      "*   **Module System:** Environment modules (e.g., Lmod) are used to manage different versions of software and libraries, allowing users to easily switch between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Access and Usage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Eligibility:** Generally available to NYU faculty, researchers, and students.\n",
      "*   **Login:** Users access the cluster via SSH to designated login nodes.\n",
      "*   **Job Submission:** Computation is primarily performed through batch jobs submitted to the SLURM scheduler. Interactive sessions on compute nodes are also often possible for development and debugging.\n",
      "*   **Training and Support:** NYU IT's High Performance Computing team provides extensive documentation, workshops, and direct support to help users get started and optimize their workflows on Greene.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you specifically meant \"Torch\" as a *PyTorch-focused* system or initiative,** it would likely refer to the heavy use of Greene's GPU nodes for deep learning, leveraging the PyTorch framework. NYU has strong research in AI/ML, and such resources are fundamental to that work.\n",
